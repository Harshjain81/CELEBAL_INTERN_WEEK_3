TASK 4: Create and Assign an Azure Policy at the Subscription Level

This document outlines the steps and Azure CLI commands to create a new Azure Policy definition and then assign it at the subscription level. For this example, we will create a policy that audits virtual machines that are not using managed disks.

---

1.  PREREQUISITES

    a.  **Azure CLI Installed and Logged In:** Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed and are logged in to your Azure account.
        ```bash
        az login
        ```
    b.  **Set Subscription (if needed):** Confirm you are working within the correct subscription.
        ```bash
        az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name or ID"
        ```

2.  DEFINE THE POLICY RULE (POLICY.JSON)

    Azure policies are defined using JSON. Create a file named `policy.json` with the following content. This policy audits VMs that use unmanaged disks.

    ```json
    {
        "if": {
            "allOf": [
                {
                    "field": "type",
                    "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
                },
                {
                    "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/storageProfile.osDisk.createOption",
                    "equals": "FromImage"
                },
                {
                    "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/storageProfile.osDisk.managedDisk.id",
                    "exists": false
                }
            ]
        },
        "then": {
            "effect": "audit"
        }
    }
    ```
    * **if:** Defines the condition under which the policy is applied.
        * `field": "type", "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"`: Targets VM resources.
        * `field": "...osDisk.createOption", "equals": "FromImage"`: Checks if the OS disk was created from an image.
        * `field": "...managedDisk.id", "exists": false`: Checks if a managed disk ID does *not* exist (meaning it's an unmanaged disk).
    * **then:** Defines the effect of the policy if the condition is met.
        * `"effect": "audit"`: This effect logs a non-compliance event in the activity log but does not stop the operation. Other effects include `deny`, `auditIfNotExists`, `deployIfNotExists`, `modify`, `disabled`.

3.  CREATE THE POLICY DEFINITION

    Now, use the Azure CLI to create the policy definition based on the `policy.json` file.

    ```bash
    # Define a variable for the policy definition name
    POLICY_DEFINITION_NAME="audit-unmanaged-vms"
    POLICY_DISPLAY_NAME="Audit VMs with Unmanaged Disks"
    POLICY_DESCRIPTION="Audits virtual machines that are not using Azure managed disks for their OS disk."
    POLICY_CATEGORY="Compute" # Categorizes the policy

    az policy definition create \
      --name "$POLICY_DEFINITION_NAME" \
      --display-name "$POLICY_DISPLAY_
